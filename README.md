# Dual N-Back (WIP)

This is a browser-based implementation of the classic Dual N-Back working memory game. The project is built with React and Vite.

> **Status:** Work in progress â€“ the game is not fully functional yet.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The built version of the game will be served under the `/dual-n-back/` path when deployed.
